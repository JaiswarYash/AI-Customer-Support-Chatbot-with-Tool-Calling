1. declarative_base:-
When you define your data models by inheriting from this base class, 
SQLAlchemy automatically maps those classes and their attributes to the corresponding tables and columns in your database

2.sessionmaker()

sessionmaker() helps to maintain consistent session configuration and retrieval within an application.
